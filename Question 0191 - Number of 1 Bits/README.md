# [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given a positive integer `n`, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight" target="_blank">Hamming weight</a>).

**Example 1:**

<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string **1011** has a total of three set bits.

**Example 2:**

<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string **10000000** has a total of one set bit.

**Example 3:**

<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string **1111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty set bits.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
