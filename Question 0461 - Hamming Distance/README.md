# [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/description/)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" target="_blank">Hamming distance</a> between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the **Hamming distance**  between them.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- `0 <=x, y <= 2^31 - 1`
