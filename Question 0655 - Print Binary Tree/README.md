# [655. Print Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-binary-tree/description/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a **0-indexed** `m x n` string matrix `res` that represents a **formatted layout** of the tree. The formatted layout matrix should be constructed using the following rules:

- The **height** of the tree is `height`and the number of rows `m` should be equal to `height + 1`.
- The number of columns `n` should be equal to `2^height+1 - 1`.
- Place the **root node** in the **middle** of the **top row** (more formally, at location `res[0][(n-1)/2]`).
- For each node that has been placed in the matrix at position `res[r][c]`, place its **left child** at `res[r+1][c-2^height-r-1]` and its **right child** at `res[r+1][c+2^height-r-1]`.
- Continue this process until all the nodes in the tree have been placed.
- Any empty cells should contain the empty string `""`.

Return the constructed matrix `res`.

**Example 1:**

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print1-tree.jpg" style="width: 141px; height: 181px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output:
[["","1",""],
["2","",""]]
```

**Example 2:**

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/03/print2-tree.jpg" style="width: 207px; height: 302px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output:
[["","","","1","","",""],
["","2","","","","3",""],
["","","4","","","",""]]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2^10]`.
- `-99 <= Node.val <= 99`
- The depth of the tree will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
